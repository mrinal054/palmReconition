## Palmprint Identification using BPNN, KNN, PNN, RBFN, and RBPNN

This project presents an effective texture-based
approach for palmprint recognition. It has three major steps - 

 - First, region of interest (ROI) is extracted from the hand image.
 - Then, features are extracted in the processing stage from the
palmprint texture using discrete cosine transform (DCT). Block-wise DCT and Holistic DCT 
are used to extract features. 
- Finally, following machine learning approaches are used for classification -
  - Back-propagation neural network (BPNN)
  - K-nearest neighbor (KNN)
  - Probabilistic neural network (PNN)
  - Radial basis function network (RBFN)
  - Radial basis probabilistic neural network (RBPNN)
